            <p>
                The EEOC enforces laws that prohibit discrimination against employees because of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information, and retaliation against employees for opposing such discrimination. To learn more about EEOC's laws, or to file a complaint, visit <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">www.eeoc.gov</a> or call 1-800-669-4000.

WHD also enforces the Family and Medical Leave Act, migrant and seasonal worker protections, worker protections in certain temporary guest worker programs, and the prevailing wages for government-funded service and construction contracts.

            <p>
                Federal employees who wish to report safety or health hazards should contact their respective agency's Designated Agency Safety and Health Officer (DASHO). For assistance filing a complaint with a DASHO, federal employees may contact OSHA's Office of Federal Agency Programs. For contact information, visit <a href="https://www.osha.gov/enforcement" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">www.osha.gov/enforcement</a>. Please note that reporting an alleged safety or health hazard to DASHO is not the same as filing a retaliation complaint with the Office of Special Counsel.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-gray-700">Office of Special Counsel (OSC)</h2>
            <p>
                The OSC handles claims of retaliation within the executive branch of the federal government from current federal employees, former employees, and applicants for federal employment. Federal employees who believe that they have suffered retaliation may file a complaint with the OSC. Visit <a href="https://www.osc.gov" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600">www.osc.gov</a> for more information.
